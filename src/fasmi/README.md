Fasmi is a F# to Jitted ASM / IL disassembler as a dotnet tool

# Getting Started

Install fasmi as a global dotnet tool

``` bash
dotnet tool install fasmi -g
``` 

or as a dotnet local tool

``` bash
dotnet new tool-manifest
dotnet tool install fasmi
```` 

# Quickstart

Create a demo.fsx F# interactive script:

``` fsharp
let inc x = x+1
```

run fasmi:
``` bash
dotnet fasmi ./demo.fsx
```

and open the generated demo.asm file:

``` asm
Demo.inc(Int32)
L0000: lea eax, [rcx+1]
L0003: ret
```

## Watch mode

run fasmi in watch mode:
``` bash
dotnet fasmi ./demo.fsx -w
```

Open the demo.fsx and demo.asm files side by side in your favorite editor, make changes to demo.fsx and save. The demo.asm file is updated on the fly.


# Usage

```
Usage: [options] <source>
Arguments:
    <source>                      The source fsx or dotnet assembly file

Options:
    --watch, -w                   Run in watch mode
    --console, -c                 Output to console
    --output, -o <output-path>    Specify the output file
    --hex, -x                     Show instruction opcodes
    --platform, -p x64|x86        Specity the platform for disassembly (x64/x86)
    --language, -l asm|il         specify the output language
```

## Input

The input can be a fsx F# script file or any dotnet .dll assemlby file. F# scripts are compiled for net 5.0.

Using a dotnet assembly as an input, you can use fasmi on any dotnet language.

## Console

With the `-c` flag, the result is output to console rather than in a file.

## Output

Use the `-o` flag to specifie the target file path and name.

## Watch

The `-w` flag runs fasmi in watch mode. The file is recompiled and disassembled automatically when saved.

## Platform

Use the `-p` flag to force x64 or x86 platform for disassembly.

## Language

Specify the target language with the `-l` flag:

* asm : disassemble the jit output as a x86/x86 .asm file
* il : disassemble the output as a MSIL .il file

## Completion

Thanks to [Fargo](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Fargo.CmdLine), fasmi can provide command line completion
for powershell, fish and bash.

To get the installation script:

```bash
# for powershell
fasmi completion powershell
# for bash
fasmi completion bash
# for fish
fasmi completion fish
```

Copy the code in your profile file.

For other shells it is possible to adapt the code.
